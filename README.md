# Form-Builder-Wix-Exam-

Hello everyone,
This is the link to the FormBuilder app I designed as part of the Wix student job selection process: https://limitless-waters-97192.herokuapp.com/

Tools and languages I learned during the project:
- Server - node.js, express
- Client - React
- MongoDB
- Material-ui
- Heroku

---------------------------------------------------------------

The above link has a certain part of the design that I could not upload as Heroku app and to see everything ready you can follow the operating instructions below.

Thanks, Roee

Operating Instructions:
1. Download and install node.js on your computer. From the following address: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Copy the URL that is in the link in github: https://github.com/RoeeBenhouse/Form-Builder-Wix-Exam-, open cmd or terminal on the computer in the desired folder, and perform a clone. (git clone <uml>)
  
3. Go to the folder where you performed the clone, copy the folder address, access it via the cmd or terminal and once you are inside the relevant folder for example: (C: \    Users \ user \ Desktop \ WixExam_RoeeBenhouse \ form-builder-app-roee \ WixExam_Roee)

4. Inside the cmd in the above folder:
A. npm in nodemon -g and then Enter.
B. yarn and then Enter.
third. Tests: node --version
npm --version
git --version


Perform yarn dev in cmd or terminal and press enter - this will run the server and open the react application in the browser.

5. -> Use the menu at the top of the page to:
-> My Forms - see the forms you have already created (there are three sample forms that load which DB the system costs.
-> New Form - Create a new form, select a name for the form, add fields (label, input, type) and display the prepared form after you have finished entering the desired details.


thank you for your time!
